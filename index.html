				The Gaither Vocal Band is an American southern gospel vocal group, named
				after its founder and leader Bill Gaither. On March 1, 2017, it was
				announced that the Gaither Vocal Band lineup consisted of Reggie Smith,
				Wes Hampton, Adam Crabb, Todd Suttles, and Bill Gaither. Although the
				group started out recording contemporary Christian music in the 1980s,
				it became known for southern gospel after the popularity of the Gaither
				Homecoming videos.

				The lineup of the band changes often, with artists leaving to work on
				solo careers, and new and old ones coming to replace them. Besides
				Gaither, singers with the longest tenure in the band include Guy Penrod
				(1995–2008), Mark Lowry (1988–2002, 2009–13), Michael English (1985–94,
				2009–13), David Phelps (1997–2005, 2009–17) and Wes Hampton
				(2005–present). The band has released 29 albums (not including
				compilations), at least 19 of which have charted. The band has also
				released 10 DVDs, which feature many other Christian artists as well.
				The Gaither Vocal Band has been honored with two Grammys and 17 Dove
				Awards.
